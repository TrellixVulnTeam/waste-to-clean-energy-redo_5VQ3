        <h4 class="newcastle-alert">INFORMATION ON PROPOSED WASTE  TO ENERGY – RESOURCE RECOVERY FACILITY <span>– PROPOSED WASTE TO ENERGY PLANT</h4>
          <div class="newcastle-info">
            <h5 class="newcastle-suptitle">about lep</h5>
            <p class="newcastle-text">LEP Waste to Energy Pty Ltd (LEP) is a Sydney based company that has developed a  business model applying plasma torches to the destruction of Municipal Solid  Waste Streams (MSW) thereby reducing the quantity of MSW sent to landfill. LEP   intends to establish a waste to energy SPV company for the first Project, currently  referred to as ‘Waste Co’.
            LEP are seeking to develop a waste to energy plant to process up to 150,000 tonnes of waste per annum. The proposed development will assist Councils in significantly reducing landfill waste, greenhouse gases and overall waste processing costs.</p>
            <h5 class="newcastle-suptitle">TECHNOLOGY – PLASMA GASIFICATION</h5>
            <p class="newcastle-text">LEP are proposing the use of Plasma Technology, specifically Plasma Gasification, to breakdown solid waste into a synthetic gas that can be used to generate electricity.
            When heat is sufficient, electrons are stripped from the atoms that creates free electrons and positive ions. The free electrons allow substances in plasma to conduct electricity. Naturally occurring plasma includes lightning and the northern lights. Plasma can also be found in fluorescent lightbulbs, plasma torches for cutting and welding and plasma televisions.</p>
            <p class="newcastle-textlist">The process provides opportunity to recombine elements into desired products:</p>
              <ul class="newcastle-lists">
                <li class="newcastle-list">Syngas (synthetic gas) can be fed to an engine to make electricity.</li>
                <li class="newcastle-list">Glassy rock like material also produced called vitrified material that encapsulates toxic inorganic materials that appear in waste generally non-toxic and does not leach. Leads to around 90% material destruction to be landfilled or incorporated into construction materials such as asphalt and concrete.</li>
              </ul>
            <p class="newcastle-text">Plasma provides high flexibility on the waste it can process and also potentially produces greater energy recovery, has potentially lower environmental footprint in terms of emissions and land use than other waste disposal methods.</p>
            <h5 class="newcastle-suptitle">KEY STEPS IN THE PROCESS </h5>
            <p class="newcastle-text">Plasma creates sufficient temperature to break molecular bonds of gasified fuel to its constituent elements. Compounds are converted to their constituent elements such as Halogens, Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Hydrogen and metals.</p>
            <h5 class="newcastle-suptitle">
            FIRST STEP – GASIFICATION USING PLASMA TORCHES
            </h5>
            <p class="newcastle-text">This process uses heat and limited oxygen to alter the raw materials to create syngas by converting waste to its constituent atomic elements as well as char and tar. Syngas is mainly Hydrogen and Carbon Monoxide, which is a fuel source to create electricity).</p>
            <h5 class="newcastle-suptitle">SECOND STEP – VITRIFICATION</h5>
            <p class="newcastle-text">Vitrification is the process of transforming the solid waste into an inert material for disposal or to be used in roads or building infrastructure.</p>
            <h5 class="newcastle-suptitle">THIRD STEP – GENERATION OF ELECTRICITY</h5>
            <p class="newcastle-text">Through the combustion of Syngas, electricity is produced which will be used to run the plant and contribute to the electrical grid.</p>
          </div>

            The development would be considered a resource recovery facility.
            Resource recovery facility means a building or place used for the recovery of resources from waste, including works or activities such as separating and sorting, processing or treating the waste, composting, temporary storage, transfer or sale of recovered resources, energy generation from gases and water treatment, but not including re-manufacture or disposal of the material by landfill or incineration.
            Note. Resource recovery facilities are a type of waste or resource management facility—see the definition of that term in this Dictionary.
          </p>
          <h5 class="newcastle-suptitle">SITE REQUIREMENTS</h5>
          <p class="newcastle-text">Site area – 20,000 m<sup>2</sup>
            Transport networks – Access to broader transport networks such as state or regional roads to provide sufficient waste streams.
            Waste storage – Operational waste storage based on continuous operation and transport timing. It is expected that waste will be received on a 12 hour day basis. Provision of a suitable weigh bridge is to be included.</p>
            <h5 class="newcastle-suptitle">EMPLOYMENT</h5>
            <p class="newcastle-text">LEP would seek to provide employment generally in accordance with contemporary   diversity strategies.Issues such as gender equality, disability action and Indigenous Australians would be promoted within the organisation.
          The project would likely generate 200 jobs during construction and 40 jobs during operation. In addition, ongoing use of local services and suppliers would generate broader positive economic impacts.
          </p>
          <h5 class="newcastle-suptitle">CURRENT WASTE CHALLENGES</h5>
              <ul class="newcastle-lists">
                <li class="newcastle-list">Waste has often been managed as out of sight and out of mind; however, it is generally accepted that each community needs to manage its own waste. The LEP proposal allows for reuse of waste through generating electricity and also reducing need for landfill.</li>
                <li class="newcastle-list">Population growth is creating significant pressure on waste management. The proposal may reduce waste to be managed, reduce greenhouse gases through reduced use of fossil fuels in electricity generation and allow land for other purposes (i.e. not landfill).</li>
                <li class="newcastle-list">Burying waste produces wastewater, methane and other discharges</li>
