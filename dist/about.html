            LEP Waste to Energy Pty (LEP) was established in 2010 to develop a
            Waste to Energ in NSW (the Project).
          </p>
          <p class="about-text">
            The concept design for the Project contemplates the use of plasma
            gasification technology for the destruction of 150,000 tonnes pa of
            municipal solid waste (MSW) to produce 30MW of electrical energy.
            Given the proposed location of the Project, there is sufficient
            waste arising within the transportation footprint of the Project to
            provide sufficient MSW. The concept design for the Project provides
            for a smaller footprint than other thermal treatment technologies,
            with greater mass to electrical energy yields, and lower levels of
            emissions and solid residue. The Project is on a 2021 to 2023
            consenting and construction timeline.
