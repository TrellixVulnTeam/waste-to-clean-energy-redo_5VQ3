        <h5 class="tech-sup">1. Summary</h5>
        <p class="tech-text">
          Plasma based W2E projects have met with varying degrees of success
          around the world, with a number of projects being abandoned. Ref 1
          provides some details, but is not comprehensive, for instance, it
          makes no reference to the successful Cheongsong 10Te/day plant in
          Korea, which has successfully destroyed MSW and produced syngas and an
          inert slag for many years This review seeks to establish why this
          should be the case, and how and why LEP’s selected Plasma technology
          will overcome the past challenges. Plasma Torches have been
          extensively used on advanced chain grate installations to destroy
          residual toxins in the flue gas and is often referred to as “flue gas
          polishing”. Ref 7 presents a comparison of key metric between advanced
          chain grates and LEP’s proposed plasma-based plant.
        </p>
        <h5 class="tech-sup">
          2. Scientific basis for the use of Plasma waste destruction
        </h5>
        <p class="tech-text">
          Plasma (Ref 2) is referred to as the “Fourth State of Matter”, and
          consists of a gas of ions. It can be artificially created by means of
          plasma torches, which form an electrical arc that in conjunction with
          a flow of carrier inert gas, such as nitrogen, generates a directed
          flow of plasma. The very high temperatures, typically in excess of
          +3000 C, generated within the plasma converts introduced organic
          material into syngas, which is primarily hydrogen and carbon monoxide.
          All inorganic materials melt in the plasma jet and flow down the
          refractory sides of the plasma reaction vessel, where they are then
          removed, quenched and crushed to produce an inert vitrified slag. The
          fact that there is no leaching means is an ideal material for
          construction fill purposes. The high temperature and the lack of
          oxygen prevents the formation of many toxic compounds such as Furans,
          Dioxins, nitrogen oxides, which along with rapid quenching and
          scrubbing of the syngas, results in extremely low levels of toxic
          emissions.
        </p>

        <h5 class="tech-sup">
          3. Plasma Transfer and Non transfer Torches in Waste Destruction
          Applications
        </h5>
        <p class="tech-text">
          There are two types of DC torches: non-transferred and transferred. In
          non-transferred DC torches, the electrodes are inside the body/housing
          of the torch itself (creating the arc there). Whereas in a transferred
          torch one electrode is outside (and is usually the conductive material
          to be treated), allowing the arc to form outside of the torch over a
          larger distance. In W2E applications transfer torches are typically
          used to heat a coke bed to which the waste material is added. This
          creates significant problems with acid corrosion of both the torches
          and the plasma reaction vessel in the handling of the slag. The use of
          coke beds has been adopted with the aim increasing the syngas
          production by means of pyrolysis type chemical reactions. In some
          instances, the plasma torches have also been placed in the lower part
          of the reaction vessel. The temperatures achieved in these
          configurations are typically only 800-9000C, as compared to +30000C
          achieved in SM’s proposed process. These lower temperatures have in a
          number of projects required an additional reaction vessel and plasma
          torches to destroy the toxic gases emitted by the pyrolysis reaction.
          LEP believes the inclusion of a pyrolysis process, along with the
          plasma heating has been a major contributor to the failure of a number
          of the projects due to corrosion and poor operational performance. In
          the case of the Advanced Plasma Power Project in Swindon in the UK, it
          had adopted a two-stage configuration. Vessel 1 had a coke bed onto
          which the MSW was fed and transfer troches for heating. The second
          vessel was included for gas clean up using plasma torches. The plant
          was shut down, and closed due to corrosion of the plasma torches. The
          Air Product’s Plant on Teesside in the UK utilised a single large
          vessel scaled up from a test rig by a factor of 35. Again, it is
          believed that it used a coke bed and fed the MSW directly onto the
          bed. Transfer torches provided the heating and were believed to have
          been located in the roof and sides of the vessel. Air Products
          shutdown the 1st Plant shortly after start-up due to severe corrosion
          in the wall of the vessel. It further abandoned the 2nd plant before
          start-up, and took a write-down of GBP 900m. No reasons were given as
          to the details behind the decision. However. Trade Union officers made
          public the basis cause of the failure. Given the above experiences LEP
          will not adopt a pyrolysis type process, but will rely on conductive
          paths in the plasma chamber for the application of the Plasma Processing U.K.
          transfer torch technology. This will be tested in the forthcoming test
          programme.

        <h5 class="tech-sup">4. The Cheongsong Korean Plant Experience</h5>
        <p class="tech-text">
          The Cheongsong Plasma Based MSW processing plant deploys a very
          similar plasma torch configuration as that proposed by SM. The
          shredded MSW is fed directly into the plasma created by a number of
          non-transfer plasma torches. Ref 5 reviews the design and operating
          experience of the Cheongsong 10Te/day W2E plant. The key items of note
          are as <span>follows</span>:-

            swirl in the reaction vessel thereby promoting the transfer of the

          5.LEP’s Selected Plasma Torches and their Application
        </h5>
        <p class="tech-text">
          LEP is currently reviewing two plasma torch suppliers, namely
          Plasma Processing U.K. with their transfer torches, and Phoenix Solutions Co’s
          (PSC’S) non-transferred torches. Regardless of which torch type is
          selected, the processed waste will be introduced directly into the
          plasma jet. The waste will have a residence time in the reaction
          vessel of approximately 1.3 seconds. The fundamental advantages are
          the rapid processing of the organic waste and the ease of handling and
          tapping the inorganic slag. This is supported by both Plasma Processing U.K. and
          PSC’s worldwide experience in plasma destruction of hazardous wastes
          (Ref 4). The proposed reaction vessel will have three 900 Kw torches
          installed in the roof of the vessel and the waste stream will be
          introduced by a feeder and fall by gravity into the plasma jet. The
          torches are capable of being articulated so as to control and adjust
          the reaction in the plasma jet. Air, and steam can be admitted as
          required to optimise the conditions and the yield of syngas. The slag
          is tapped at the bottom of the vessel. In PSC’s vortex-stabilised
          torches, the anodes have an operating life of approx. 3000 hours,
          whilst the cathodes has an operating life of approx. 600 hrs, but can
          be easily replaced within 30 mins, thereby minimising down-time.
          Plasma Processing U.K. torches are transfer torches and have much longer operating
          lives due to on-line replacement of the <span>cathodes</span>.
        </p>
        <h5 class="tech-sup">6.LEP’s Testing Programmes</h5>
        <p class="tech-text">
          LEP conducted a series of tests at PSC’s test rig in the USA,
          utilising a mixed waste stream including a significant proportion of
          biological material. The tests were entirely successful, and were
          witnessed by an Independent Engineer (Ref 8), who reported that the
          tests were entirely successful in confirming the proposed process. A
          further test programme in Feb 2020 was undertaken by LEP/SM, based on
          waste streams containing plastics and cardboard, which are readily
          available as feedstock. It is now intended to conduct a similar series
          of tests with Plasma Processing U.K. in Oct/Nov 2020, so as to validate Plasma Processing U.K.
          as a torch and technology supplier.
